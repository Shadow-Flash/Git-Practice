# Git Practice

I am just practicing some git's command in it.

## Why ?

Everything is being practiced for manual doing!

## Commands Practiced
* `git init`
    > It will initialize git in the working folder.

* `git add .`
    > This will stage all the files in which the changes are made or new file added.

* `git add <FILENAME>`
    > This will stage only that file which you will name it.
    > You can name multiple files also.
    > eg: git add index.html index.js

* `git status`
    > This will show you the status of the current branch, basically your changes.
    > Will be good to run after every `git add`.

* `git commit -m <MESSAGE>`
    > Giving the message to your change that you and other dev's can understand.

* `git commit -m <MESSAGE> -m <DESCRIPTION>`
    > You can add some description to the commit message, describing your own commit.

* `git commit -am <MESSAGE>`
    > This command can directly add and commit simultaneouly.
    > But you can't use this when you have created a new file, you can only use this on modified files.

* `git push -u origin <BRANCH NAME>`
    > This will set the upstream that is basically means that when ever you use `git push` it will push that branch without asking you.

* `git push`
    > This will push your code to github repo.
    > All the changes will be pushed to github repo.

* `git pull`
    > This will fetch all the changes from Github repo.
* `git checkout -b <NEW BRANCH NAME>` 
    > You can make a duplicate branch of your current branch using this command.
    > eg: CURRENT-BRANCH: main 
    >     git checkout -b new-branch
    > CURRENT-BRANCH: new-branch (duplicate of main branch)
* `git branch`
    > You can make multiple branches and to know in which branch are you in.
    > This will tell the current branch as well as branches which are in local-machine.
* `git branch -all`
    > This will let you know all the branches in local as well as in origin.
* `git branch -d <BRANCH NAME>`
    > If you want to delete any branch from your repo.
* `git remote add origin <LINK OF REPO>`
    > Once you have created a new folder and initialized git in it.
    > You have to make new repo in github and set the connection between your local repo with origin
* `git remote -v`
    > After adding this will let you know the remotes of current repo.
* `git reset <FILENAME>`
    > If you want to unstage the current add then just run this.
* `git diff`
    > This will show the difference between from current branch and main.
* `git log`
    > This will show all the commits that has been made yet.
* `git reset --hard origin main
    > It will reset all the changes that has been made yet from origin.

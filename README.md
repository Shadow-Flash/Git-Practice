# Git Practice

I am just practicing some git's command in it.

## Why ?

Everything is being practiced for manual doing!

## Commands Practiced
* `git init`
    > It will initialize git in the working folder.
* `git add .`
    > This will stage all the files in which the changes are made or new file added.
* `git add <FILENAME>`
    > This will stage only that file which you will name it.
* `git status`
* `git commit -m <MESSAGE>`
* `git commit -m <MESSAGE> -m <DESCRIPTION>`
* `git commit -am <MESSAGE>` 
* `git commit -am <MESSAGE> -m <DESCRIPTION>`
